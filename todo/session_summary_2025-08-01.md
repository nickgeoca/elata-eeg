# Session Summary & Next Steps (2025-08-01)

This document summarizes the debugging progress for the EEG Kiosk application and outlines the plan for the next session.

## Summary of Progress

We have been troubleshooting a persistent issue where the frontend application crashes, causing both the WebSocket and SSE connections to terminate abruptly with a `1006` error code.

Our investigation has systematically eliminated several potential causes:

1.  **Backend Compilation:** Initial Rust compiler errors in `crates/daemon/src/api.rs` were successfully resolved.
2.  **Backend Connection Logic:** We initially hypothesized that the backend's `websocket_sink` was mishandling connections. A fix was applied to add a read loop, but this did not resolve the core issue, confirming the backend is not the source of the crash.
3.  **Frontend Rendering Crash (Hypothesis):** The logs consistently show the backend is operating correctly, sending data, while the client connections drop suddenly. This strongly indicates a client-side rendering crash is the root cause.
4.  **FFT View Crash:** We identified and fixed a crash in the `EegDataVisualizer.tsx` component that occurred when switching to the FFT view. The `FftRenderer` was being rendered with incomplete data.

## Current Status & Hypothesis

Despite fixing the FFT view, the application still crashes on the default "Signal Graph" view. This leads to our current, high-confidence hypothesis:

**The crash is occurring within the `EegRenderer.tsx` component.** This component is responsible for the primary data visualization and is likely attempting to access a property on a `null` or `undefined` object during its initial render cycle, before all necessary data and configuration are available.

## Plan for Next Session

Our next steps will be to pinpoint and resolve this final bug:

1.  **Analyze `EegRenderer.tsx`:** Read and thoroughly analyze the code in `kiosk/src/components/EegRenderer.tsx`.
2.  **Identify the Bug:** Scrutinize the rendering logic, paying close attention to how props like `config` and `dataBuffer` are accessed and used, especially during the component's first render.
3.  **Implement the Fix:** Propose and apply a patch to ensure the component is resilient to partially-loaded data and does not attempt to render until all required props are valid.
