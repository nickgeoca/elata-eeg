I can't create the markdown file directly in ask mode, but I can provide you with the content that you can save to the todo folder:

## 1. How much of a haul is this? Are we almost there?

Looking at the current state, I'd say you're about **30% of the way there**. Here's the breakdown:

**What you already have:**
- ✅ Plugin structure with separate directories
- ✅ Basic plugin manifests (plugin.toml)
- ✅ Plugin trait system in place
- ✅ Workspace organization

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Published core crates (eeg_types, pipeline, sensors)
- ❌ Dynamic loading mechanism
- ❌ Plugin discovery system
- ❌ Independent build system
- ❌ Version compatibility management

The biggest hurdles are:
- **ABI stability** in Rust (this is a fundamental challenge)
- **Dependency management** for independently versioned plugins
- **Plugin discovery and loading** infrastructure

## 2. Is there a way to do it with git clone in the plugin folder?

Yes! There's a **much simpler approach** that could work with minimal changes:

### The "Git Clone Plugin" Approach

Instead of full dynamic loading, you could:

1. **Keep the workspace structure** but allow plugins to be git cloned
2. **Use a plugin discovery script** that scans the plugins directory
3. **Automatically add new plugins to the workspace**

Here's how it would work:

```bash
# User clones a plugin into the plugins folder
cd plugins
git clone https://github.com/user/my-awesome-plugin.git

# Run a script to update the workspace
../scripts/update-workspace.sh

# Now the plugin is part of the build
cargo build
```

The script would:
- Scan the plugins directory for new plugin directories
- Check if they have a valid Cargo.toml
- Update the root Cargo.toml workspace members
- Run cargo check to validate

**Advantages:**
- Much simpler than dynamic loading
- Keeps the current build system
- Plugins can be developed independently
- No ABI stability issues
- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages:**
- Still requires recompiling the daemon
- All plugins share the same dependency versions
- Not truly "runtime" independent

## 3. Markdown Content for todo/ folder

Here's the content you can save as `todo/plugin_independence_plan.md`:

```markdown
# Plugin Independence Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have
- ✅ Plugin structure with separate directories
- ✅ Basic plugin manifests (plugin.toml)
- ✅ Plugin trait system in place
- ✅ Workspace organization in Cargo.toml
- ✅ Three example plugins (basic_voltage_filter, brain_waves_fft, csv_recorder)

### What's Missing
- ❌ Published core crates (eeg_types, pipeline, sensors)
- ❌ Dynamic loading mechanism
- ❌ Plugin discovery system
- ❌ Independent build system
- ❌ Version compatibility management

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Full Dynamic Loading (Complex)
- Publish core crates to crates.io
- Implement dynamic loading with libloading
- Create plugin SDK with stable ABI
- Build plugin discovery and management system
- **Effort**: High (3-6 months)
- **Benefits**: True runtime independence
- **Risks**: ABI stability, complex debugging

### Option 2: Git Clone Workspace Approach (Simple)
- Keep current workspace structure
- Create script to auto-update workspace members
- Allow plugins to be git cloned into plugins folder
- **Effort**: Low (1-2 weeks)
- **Benefits**: Simple, maintains current architecture
- **Risks**: Still requires recompilation, shared dependencies

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Start with Option 2 for quick wins
- Gradually move toward Option 1
- **Effort**: Medium (1-3 months)
- **Benefits**: Progressive improvement, manageable risk
- **Risks**: Longer timeline, two-phase implementation

## Recommended Implementation: Git Clone Workspace

### Phase 1: Basic Git Clone Support (1 week)

#### 1.1 Create Plugin Discovery Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/update-workspace.sh

PLUGINS_DIR="plugins"
CARGO_TOML="Cargo.toml"

# Find all plugin directories
PLUGIN_DIRS=()
for dir in "$PLUGINS_DIR"/*/; do
    if [ -f "$dir/Cargo.toml" ]; then
        PLUGIN_DIRS+=("$(basename "$dir")")
    fi
done

# Generate workspace members
echo "[workspace]" > temp_cargo.toml
echo "resolver = \"2\"" >> temp_cargo.toml
echo "members = [" >> temp_cargo.toml

# Add core crates
echo '    "crates/daemon",' >> temp_cargo.toml
echo '    "crates/sensors",' >> temp_cargo.toml
echo '    "crates/eeg_types",' >> temp_cargo.toml
echo '    "crates/pipeline",' >> temp_cargo.toml
echo '    "crates/boards",' >> temp_cargo.toml

# Add plugins
for plugin in "${PLUGIN_DIRS[@]}"; do
    echo "    \"plugins/$plugin\"," >> temp_cargo.toml
done

echo "]" >> temp_cargo.toml

# Add workspace dependencies
echo "" >> temp_cargo.toml
echo "[workspace.dependencies]" >> temp_cargo.toml
# ... copy existing workspace dependencies

# Replace original Cargo.toml
mv temp_cargo.toml "$CARGO_TOML"

echo "Workspace updated with plugins: ${PLUGIN_DIRS[*]}"
```

#### 1.2 Update Plugin Documentation
Create `plugins/README.md` with instructions:
```markdown
# Adding New Plugins

## Quick Start
1. Clone your plugin into the plugins directory:
   ```bash
   cd plugins
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-plugin.git
   ```

2. Update the workspace:
   ```bash
   ../scripts/update-workspace.sh
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Plugin Requirements
- Must have a Cargo.toml in the root directory
- Should follow the naming convention: `plugins/your-plugin-name/`
- Must implement the EegPlugin trait from the pipeline crate
```

#### 1.3 Create Plugin Template
Set up a template repository for new plugins:
```toml
# Template Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "{{plugin_name}}"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
anyhow = { workspace = true }
tracing = { workspace = true }
bytes = { workspace = true }
uuid = { workspace = true, features = ["v4"] }
eeg_types = { path = "../../crates/eeg_types" }
pipeline = { path = "../../crates/pipeline" }
# Add other dependencies as needed
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Plugin Management (2-3 weeks)

#### 2.1 Plugin Validation
- Add validation to the update script
- Check for required plugin structure
- Validate plugin metadata
- Test basic compilation

#### 2.2 Plugin Configuration
- Standardize plugin.toml format
- Add configuration validation
- Support for plugin-specific settings

#### 2.3 Dependency Management
- Handle conflicting dependencies
- Support for plugin-specific dependency versions
- Better error messages for dependency conflicts

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional)

#### 3.1 Plugin Registry
- Simple plugin index
- Plugin discovery from remote repositories
- Version management

#### 3.2 Plugin Testing
- Automated plugin testing
- Compatibility checking
- Performance benchmarks

## Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Basic Implementation
1. [ ] Create update-workspace.sh script
2. [ ] Test with existing plugins
3. [ ] Document the process
4. [ ] Create plugin template

### Week 2: Enhancement
1. [ ] Add plugin validation
2. [ ] Improve error handling
3. [ ] Add configuration support
4. [ ] Test with new plugins

### Week 3: Polish
1. [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
2. [ ] Create example plugins
3. [ ] Set up CI/CD for plugin validation
4. [ ] Performance testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can git clone plugins into the plugins folder
- [ ] Running update-workspace.sh automatically includes new plugins
- [ ] cargo build succeeds with new plugins
- [ ] Plugins can be developed independently
- [ ] Clear documentation for plugin developers
- [ ] Existing plugins continue to work unchanged

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Dependency Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Use workspace dependencies where possible
- **Mitigation**: Provide clear error messages for conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Document dependency best practices

### Risk: Breaking Changes
- **Mitigation**: Test with all existing plugins
- **Mitigation**: Version the update script
- **Mitigation**: Provide rollback mechanism

### Risk: User Experience
- **Mitigation**: Make the process as simple as possible
- **Mitigation**: Provide clear error messages
- **Mitigation**: Include examples and templates
```

This approach gives you a practical path forward with minimal complexity while still achieving the goal of independent plugin development through git clone.
