# Debugging Summary: GPIO Singleton and ADS1299 Timing

This document summarizes the steps taken to diagnose and resolve the DRDY timeout errors in the dual-chip ElataV2 system.

### Attempted Fixes

*   **1. Isolate the Acquisition Loop (Diagnostic Code)**
    *   **Action:** Modified the `ElataV2Driver::acquire` method to only start and read from a single chip, even after both were initialized.
    *   **Result (Failure):** The DRDY timeout persisted. This was a critical diagnostic step, as it proved the error was not in the acquisition logic itself but in the initialization sequence of the second driver.

*   **2. Refactor GPIO Handling (Dependency Injection)**
    *   **Action:** Identified that `rppal::gpio::Gpio::new()` was being called twice, causing a resource conflict. The code was refactored to create a single `Arc<Gpio>` instance in `ElataV2Driver` and pass it as a reference to each `Ads1299Driver`.
    *   **Result (Partial Success):** This fixed a definite architectural bug and is a necessary change for stability. However, it did not resolve the DRDY timeouts on its own, indicating another issue was present.

*   **3. Increase ADS1299 Reset Delay**
    *   **Action:** After analyzing the logs from the previous step, it was clear that register writes were not taking effect. The hypothesis was that the `10us` delay after a hardware `RESET` command was too short for the chip to be ready for new commands. The delay was increased to `10ms`.
    *   **Result (Success):** This was the final fix. With the increased delay, the chips are now correctly configured, and when combined with the GPIO refactoring, the system operates without DRDY timeouts.

### Conclusion

The problem was caused by two separate but related issues:
1.  A **GPIO singleton conflict** from multiple `Gpio::new()` calls.
2.  An **insufficient reset delay** for the ADS1299 chips, preventing proper configuration.

Both issues have been resolved.
