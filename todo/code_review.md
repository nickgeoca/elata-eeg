# EEG System Audit Summary

Based on my review of the codebase, here's a summary of the key components and architecture:

## System Overview

The EEG system consists of multiple crates working together:

• eeg_types: Shared data structures and communication types
• sensors: Hardware drivers (ADS1299, Mock EEG)
• boards: Board-specific implementations (Elata V1/V2)
• pipeline: Core data processing pipeline framework
• daemon: Main application server and plugin supervisor
• plugins: Modular processing stages (basic_voltage_filter, brain_waves_fft, csv_recorder)

## What We Did

• Reviewed the overall crate structure and dependencies
• Examined the pipeline architecture including stages, graph execution, and memory allocation
• Analyzed the daemon server implementation and WebSocket communication
• Inspected sensor drivers (ADS1299) and mock data generation
• Reviewed plugin implementations and integration points

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Pipeline System

The pipeline crate implements a flexible, multi-stage processing framework:

• Stages: Modular processing units that transform data packets (RawI32 → Voltage → Filtered)
• Graph Execution: Topologically sorted stage execution with configurable backpressure
• Memory Management: Recycled buffer allocator to reduce heap fragmentation
• Error Handling: Per-stage error policies (Fatal, DrainThenStop, SkipPacket)
• Control Plane: Commands for reconfiguration, recording control, and pipeline management

### Current Working Components

1. Data Flow: EEG source → to_voltage conversion → WebSocket sink
2. Mock Driver: Generates realistic EEG data with multiple frequency bands
3. WebSocket Communication: Binary protocol with JSON headers for real-time data streaming
4. Plugin System: Basic voltage filtering and FFT analysis plugins

### Key Issues/Concerns Identified
1. Thread Safety: Some components use std::sync::Mutex where tokio::sync::Mutex might be more appropriate
2. Error Propagation: Driver errors don't always propagate cleanly to the UI layer
3. Configuration Validation: Limited validation of ADC configurations before hardware initialization
4. Plugin Integration: Plugins are defined but not fully integrated into the pipeline system
5. Code Duplication: Similar patterns exist across different drivers that could be unified

## What We're Currently Working On

• Pipeline stage implementation and configuration
• WebSocket data streaming protocol
• Memory-efficient buffer management
• Plugin system integration
• Hardware driver reliability

## Next Steps for Improvement

1. Refactor Sensor Drivers: Create unified trait implementations and reduce duplication
2. Enhance Plugin Integration: Make plugins fully configurable through the pipeline system
3. Improve Error Handling: Ensure proper error propagation from hardware to UI
4. Optimize Memory Usage: Expand the allocator pattern to more stage types
5. Standardize Configuration: Create better validation for all driver configurations
6. Testing Framework: Add more comprehensive tests for the pipeline execution

The system shows a solid foundation with clear separation of concerns, but needs refinement in error handling,
plugin integration, and validation layers.
