# Notes for AI

*   If the user requests the creation of a new task or note to be tracked, create a new `.md` file in the `todo/` directory. Ensure you also add a corresponding entry or link to this new file in [`todo/README.md`](./todo/README.md:1).

When working on a task within a specific sub-project (e.g., `kiosk/`, `crates/daemon/`, `crates/pipeline/`), **always start by reviewing the `ai_prompt.md` file within that sub-project's directory.** This document provides crucial context about the project's structure, data flow, and key components, which will help in understanding the task and formulating a plan.

Each sub-project folder (like `daemon/`, `driver/`, `kiosk/`) contains:
* `ai_prompt.md`: For project overview and architectural context. **Consult this first.** It begins with a standard prefix: "this is an architecture doc for the ai to understand the context of this directory rapidly".

`ai_prompt.md` (in sub-project directories like `daemon/`, `driver/`, `kiosk/`)
The goal of this doc is to provide rapid context for an AI (or human) developer to understand the specific sub-project's codebase. It is prefixed with "this is an architecture doc for the ai to understand the context of this directory rapidly". The AI can update this document when changes are made to the codebase, making it easier to maintain and use in the future. Ideally, this document remains concise, with the source code providing the specifics.
